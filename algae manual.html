		<div>Designing source water monitoring systems using this three-tier framework ensures monitoring goals are established and limits scenarios where resources are used to monitor parameters in a single tier. It offers robust early warning while conserving resources. Monitoring parameters have various advantages and shortcomings that are presented in a review of the literature. The performance of the early warning parameters in surveyed utilities grouped by the tier method is shown in the survey response graphic.
 
Given the complexity and variability of source water conditions that promote cyanobacterial blooms, alert thresholds for monitoring parameters are vastly site-specific. Surveyed utilities reported a wide range of alert thresholds for chlorophyll-a (10-50 μg/L), cell counts (200-100,000 cells/mL), phycocyanin fluorescence (2-5 RFU), T&O compounds (8-10 ng/L; 5-30 TON), and cyanotoxins (0.3-5 μg/L).


Utilities should internally develop alert thresholds for select parameters by compiling and analyzing monitoring data. Alert thresholds can also be established by coupling parameters in the different monitoring Tiers, e.g., ATP/cell, ATP/ chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-a/cell, etc. When designing an early warning system, it is essential to consider the frequency and type of blooms at the source, reliability of the signal, staffing, analytical capabilities, and cost, such as those shown in EWA Tools Summary Table.</div>

		<div>Source control strategies can be implemented to inhibit planktonic or benthic cyanobacteria growth before metabolites are generated (i.e., cyanotoxins or T&O compounds). Early detection of cyanobacteria is critical to successful proactive source control management. A variety of in-lake/reservoir control measures are implemented to reduce the abundance of cyanobacterial biomass or decrease the amount of available phosphorous (P). Source control strategies can be classified into chemical, mechanical/physical, and biological methods.</div>
		<div>Early warning monitoring programs require extensive financial and staff resources to perform sampling, laboratory analyses, and data interpretation. Surveyed utilities have incorporated various parameters into their programs and reported varying levels of success. Early warning monitoring goals for cyanobacteria can be divided into three tiers:</div>
		<div>Green algae
</div>
		<div>Both
</div>
		<div>^
</div>
		<div>Early Warning Systems</div>
		<div>Simple plants that contain photosynthetic pigments and which usually are microscopic and aquatic in form and habit; green algae do not produce cyanotoxins or taste and odor compounds.</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Naturally occurring photosynthetic microorganisms that are found in aquatic environments, including lakes, streams, rivers, reservoirs, ponds, and freshwater-influenced estuaries; often referred to as “blue-green algae” because of intracellular phycocyanin (blue) pigments; some (not all) species may produce nuisance metabolites (i.e., cyanotoxins, taste and odor compounds).</div>

		<div>Toxins that are generated by some cyanobacterial species, commonly referred to as algal toxins. They are classified as neurotoxins (causing nerve damage) e.g., anatoxins; hepatotoxins (causing liver damage) e.g., microcystins, nodularin, saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsins; dermatotoxins (causing skin irritation) e.g., lyngbyatoxins; and cytotoxins (causing cell damage).</div>
		<div>Nutrient Sequestration</div>
		<div>Most of the control strategies presented above provide only temporary relief of symptoms of water quality degradation such as anoxia, redox-dependent nutrient and contaminant loading, and cyanobacterial biomass. Reduction of external nutrient inputs should still be a primary focus of restoration efforts as treatment benefits are commonly disrupted by continued external nutrient inputs. Therefore, an assessment of external versus internal nutrient roles in source water impairment should be conducted before selecting and implementing control strategies.</div>

		<div>Chemical treatment methods consist of algaecides and nutrient sequestering chemicals frequently applied by boat. Copper- and peroxide-based algaecides damage cellular integrity and cause cell death, limiting bloom expansion in a drinking water source. Nutrient sequestering additives such as alum, polyaluminum chloride (PACl), iron salts, and bentonite clays bind P in the water column, creating nutrient limited conditions that inhibit cyanobacteria growth.</div>

		<div>Lag phase: a period of adaptation during which the organisms adjust to culture conditions.

Exponential phase: the period of cell division characterized by a predictable doubling of cell numbers; slope of the curve during the exponential phase is dependent upon speciesspecific intrinsic factors and the availability of resources.

Stationary phase: At this stage, the cell growth rate slows or stops. Growth is inhibited by lack of resources and increases in waste production; cells tend to produce secondary metabolites.

Death phase: the number of viable cells decreases; cell death is due to resource depletion and waste production. Intracellular contents are released.</div>

		<div>What is the Goal of Your Source Water Monitoring?</div>
		<div>Short
</div>
		<div>Mechanical control methods include sediment dredging to remove nutrients, artificial mixing to prevent thermal stratification, and aeration. Aeration increases dissolved oxygen and inhibits the release of Mn2+, Fe2+, and P from sediments. Sonication uses high frequency sound waves to collapse gas vacuoles, impairing the ability of cyanobacteria to migrate through the water column. The reported success of sonication is inconsistent; it appears to be more applicable in engineered reservoirs and dependent on site specific characteristics. Biological control methods limit growth of cyanobacteria through biomanipulation and natural system restoration.</div>

		<div>Cyanobacterial blooms challenge utilities in their commitment to producing high-quality drinking water due to the potential production of secondary metabolites such as cyanotoxins or taste and odor (T&O) compounds. When producing these metabolites, cyanobacterial blooms are commonly referred to as harmful algal blooms (HABs).

This manual offers guidance on early detection and source water management strategies to minimize the risk associated with cyanobacteria blooms. Information presented here is a synthesis of project findings from a survey of drinking water utilities with bench- and field-scale evaluations.

The manual provides utilities with strategies that can be used to (1) create a structured early warning monitoring program using a tiered approach, (2) evaluate benthic sources of cyanobacteria, and (3) evaluate methods to prevent or control blooms in source water supplies.</div>

		<div>Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)</div>
		<div>A survey of 35 drinking water utilities across the United States, Canada, and Australia identified common practices with early warning tools and source control strategies to manage cyanobacteria or reduce nutrient concentrations at the source. These charts summarize the different aspects of early warning and source control that utilities find essential. Analytical turnaround times and frequency of monitoring warrant the greatest consideration for inclusion in early warning programs. Release of intracellular metabolites, environmental impacts of algaecides, and nutrient deposition are top considerations when implementing an engineered source control strategy.</div>
